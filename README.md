# ESDTIs
This repo covers research regarding Extremely-Short-Duration Transient Interactions (ESDTIs)

## Overview
ESDTIs are defined in this upcoming paper as interactions between a transiting body, often a satellite, and a star. All observations in this study are done via publicly available Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) information. The preliminary investigation is done with 994 total observations:

| Category      | Number |
| ------------- | ------ |
| Baselines     | 981    |
| Transit Frame | 13     |
| Total         | 994    |

This preliminary group is still beign researched, and in-progress files are available for some of the information on ESDTI impact research so far.
